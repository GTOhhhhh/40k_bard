  "content": "\"Karaashi\" Bombastus was an Iron Hands Dreadnought that served with the 65th Clan-Company, under the Command of Captain Ulrach Branthan and based aboard the Sisypheum.[1a]  He was armed with a Powerfist and Stormbolter, Flame Cannons and a retro-fitted Missile Rack that rotated down over his rear armour plates.[1b]\n As a warrior he was given to great passions and furious charges.  With a temper to match the bellicose temperament of the volcano and a love of fiery destruction, he was named \"Karaashi\" after the volcanic peak into which Ferrus Manus's life pod had crashed.  This stuck even after his interment in a Dreadnought Sarcophagus, the transition from mortal flesh to iron had only increased his aggression in battle.[1b]\n Bombastus fought in the Battle of the Corollis Star.[1c]\n Bombastus would later meet his final end in an action against the Iron Warriors on Iydris; he fought a duel against the Iron Warriors Dreadnought Warsmith Berossus and had the upper hand due to his relative experience fighting as a Dreadnought and Berossus's weapons lacking ammunition after fighting against the Eldar guardians of the planet.  However, he was hit by a blast from Cadaras Grendel's meltagun, then pounded and crushed by Berossus's Siege Hammer.[1c]\n"
