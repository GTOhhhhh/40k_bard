  "content": "Gunz are a type of Ork fleet weapon.[1]\n Above all weapons Ork favour massive shell-hurling macrocannons grouped together in batteries. One battery comprises any number of different types of weapons, but most fire projectiles of one sort or another. Some of them are made from scrap while others are 'improved' versions of looted Imperial macrobatteries. Ork inclination towards firepower means that any gap in the haphazard armour plating is filled with a gun. Usually referred to simply as Gunz these Ork macrobatteries fire volley after volley of solid shot and explosive shells, overwhelming an enemy in a torrent of destruction. However, they don't always work as intended and are prone to misfires and jamming. They may also be deactivated for repairs or 'improvements' by Ork Mekboy. Overall, these weapons are unpredictable but most of the time are frighteningly effective.[1]\n The larger cousin of Gunz are known as Heavy Gunz. Alongside more conventional macrocannons Orks often mount massed batteries of very powerful but short ranged weapons on their ships. Known as Heavy Gunz, these batteries fire dense slugs of scrap metal massing thousands of tonnes as well as jury-rigged plasma bombs. These projectiles quickly become fatally inaccurate over long ranges so the ship becomes vulnerable to long ranged fire. Nonetheless they cause terrifying damage to any ship at close range.[1]\n Gunz battery[2]\n Heavy Gunz battery[2]\n \n"
