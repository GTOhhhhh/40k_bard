  "content": "'Zerkers are members of House Goliath who have become rage-filled warriors, after abusing growth stimms, surgeries and other methods to push the extreme physical limits of their bodies.[1]\n This has also resulted in them suffering mutations, such as spontaneous bone spur mutations which are then used as weapons, and rampant uncontrollable muscle growth that makes 'Zerkers the largest of House Goliath's members. These physical changes have led Zerkers to be classified as post-human and they frequently join Goliath's Underhive gangs, where they bring mindless, rageful destruction to the House's enemies.[1]\n"
