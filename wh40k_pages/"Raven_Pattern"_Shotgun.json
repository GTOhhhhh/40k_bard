  "content": "The \"Raven Pattern\" Shotgun, also known as the Deliverance Pattern Shotgun[2] is a upgraded shotgun created by Harl Greyweaver, exclusive to Space Marines of the Raven Guard.[Needs Citation]\n Raven Guard scouts are among the best recon the Astartes has to offer, identifying targets for quick strikes and disrupting enemy logistics. For this reason, Raven Guard serving in the Jericho Reach Deathwatch are commonly deployed to strike missions in the Canis Salient, using their stealth to operate behind enemy lines and strike Tau targets. During a recent strike mission, shotgun fire gave away a scout’s position and compromised the entire mission.[Needs Citation]\n In response, Harl Greyweaver used an ancient technique incorporating flash and sound suppressors into the scout’s muzzle (a long black cylinder attached to the weapon’s barrel) making it completely silent when fired, without reducing damage or the ability to make use of variant forms of ammo.[Needs Citation]\n This article needs work on its citations.For help on citation see the citation guidelines.
