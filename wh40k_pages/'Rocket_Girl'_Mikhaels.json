  "content": "Master Sergeant Mikhaels is perhaps one of the few members of the 13th Penal Legion for which records exist beyond just a dossier picture and a nickname.[1b]  A former enlisted member of the Imperial Guard Mikhaels worked her way up the ranks until she achieved the rating Master-At-Arms, then she threw it all away.  No one knows why she chose to murder a fellow Master Sergeant but she was promptly shipped off to the penal colony of Barbarellus where she would have remained had Colonel Schaeffer not taken note of her exceptional skills.[1a]\n As a member of the \"Last Chancers\" the woman now known as 'Rocket Girl' to those she serves with brings her years of experience with heavy weapons to bear.  Typically armed with her trademark missile launcher Rocket Girl seems to always know exactly where to place her ordnance to achieve maximum results.  Since joining she has formed an unusual relationship with 'Fingers' Vagin who now acts as her loader, and keeps her supplied with all sorts of 'unusual' ammunition.[1a]\n"
