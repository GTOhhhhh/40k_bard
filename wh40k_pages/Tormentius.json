  "content": "Tormentius is the code name of the Eversor Assassin 0034/H/N.[1]\n In M41, he had completed 67 missions and had a kill ratio of 99:1. However despite having a 100 percent success rate, Tormentius was placed on permastasis after the Eversor began displaying erratic extremes of psychopathic behavior. Sometime later, though, this was revoked when the Imperium's efforts to reclaim the world Uphrateus, were at risk of failing. Having just been freed from the Eye of Terror, after 200 years, the former Imperial world was heavily infested by the forces of Chaos. One of which, was the Word Bearers Chaos Lord Saegius Mindblighter, who began casting a summoning to bring forth a Khorne Daemon host, during the battle.[1]\n While two of the Space Wolves' Great Companies were being sent to reinforce the Imperial forces' efforts to reclaim Uphrateus, they would arrive too late to stop Mindblighter's summoning. Now desperate to prevent that from happening, the Imperium then ordered the Officio Assassinorum to immediately revoke Tormentius' permastasis and dispatch the Eversor to kill Mindblighter. In order for him to be successful in this singular non-deviation erasure mission, the Assassinorum was also told to modify Tormentius so that he will abandon all covert programming and have maximum aggression patterns and pain thresholds. Once the Eversor arrives on Uphrateus, the Imperium has estimated that Tormentius will have three hours to infiltrate Mindblighter's cathedral and kill the Chaos Lord, before the summoning is completed.[1]\n The following information is not to be regarded as officially sanctioned and/ or is not written from an in-universe point of view. A detailed explanation of the term \"Trivia\" as used in the Lexicanum can be found here.\n"
