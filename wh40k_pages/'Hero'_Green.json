  "content": "While much of Hero's past is classified or lost prior to his becoming a member of the \"13th Penal Legion\" his real name is known to be Green, and he was an officer in the Imperial Guard.[1b] Green was set for great things within the Guard.  Graduating top of his class and maintained a remarkably unblemished record.  All this changed, however, when he refused a direct order to throw his men's lives away in suicide charge at what he believed to be a pointless objective.[1a]\n Stripped of his rank and sent to the penal colony at Bassus Prime 'Hero' was recruited into the Last Chancer's by Colonel Schaeffer.  He is typically armed with a lasgun, laspistol and a close combat weapon of some sort, and will stand his ground no matter what.  Shrugging off wounds that would kill many lesser men through pure willpower.[1a]\n This version of 'Hero' should not be confused with the former Commissar Moerck who participated in the Brightsword Mission.[2a][2b]\n"
