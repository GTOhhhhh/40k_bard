  "content": "'Death' Strike is a codename given to a Catachan Colonel. Colonel Strike was the commander of the 183rd regiment of Catachan Jungle Fighters at the start of the Pandorax Incursion. He earned his nickname when still only a squad Sergeant, fighting against insurgents in the dense forests of Burlion VIII. His opponents said that fighting against Strike and his men meant only one thing – certain death, indeed the Colonel himself is statistically 88% as effective as the average Deathstrike Missile. He has also faced down Catachan Devils back on his home world and lived not only to tell the tale, but also to wear their teeth on a chain around his neck. The 183rd regiment was en route to the Maelstrom war zone when catastrophic engine failure on their transport craft resulted in them being stranded on Pythos just before Abaddon’s invasion began. Commander Azrael later said that were it not for Colonel Strike, Pythos would have been completely overrun. This personal commendation from the Dark Angels Chapter cemented Colonel Strike's image as a hero of the Imperium.[1][2][3]\n Strike and his regiment are still present on Pythos, which now receives a constant supply of fresh reinforcements from other Astra Militarum regiments. Whilst martial bonding practices are considered to be a positive, headstrong Guardsmen have attempted to arm-wrestle the Colonel on several occasions, resulting in the practice being banned due to the strain placed on medical staff (in less extreme cases) and a lack of cybernetic limb replacements (in more severe cases).[2]\n"
