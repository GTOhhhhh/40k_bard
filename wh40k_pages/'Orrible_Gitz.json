  "content": "'Orrible Gitz are Grots, who been assigned some of the most horrible jobs in Ork camps.[1]\n This includes cleaning out Squig pens, which leaves them covered in muck. However 'Orrible Gitz take a suspicious level of pride in their work. The dreadful smells and missing body parts that result from such duties, though, are off-putting to everyone. Even those Orks whose own body hygiene is suspect at best.[1]\n"
